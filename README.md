# Java OOP: Shipping Volume & Mayan Numeral Converter

## Overview
This project contains two Java applications to practice decision-making, loops, the Math class, and number formatting.

1. **Shipping Calculator**: Calculates the volume and surface area of two container typesâ€”`Box` and `Tube`. After entering container dimensions, the program identifies the container with the largest volume and the smallest surface area.

2. **Mayan Numeral Converter**: Converts an Arabic numeral to the ancient Mayan numeral system, using underscores, O's, and U's to represent Mayan symbols. The program prompts the user for a non-negative integer, validates it, and outputs the corresponding Mayan representation.

## Features
- **Shipping Calculator**:
  - Volume and surface area calculations for boxes and tubes.
  - User input validation and formatted output with three decimal places.
  - Identifies container with the largest volume and smallest surface area.

- **Mayan Numeral Converter**:
  - Conversion of base-10 numbers to Mayan numerals using loops and arithmetic.
  - Input validation for non-negative numbers only.

## Usage
1. Compile `Box.java`, `Tube.java`, and the driver program for the Shipping Calculator.
2. Run the driver to enter dimensions and view container information.
3. Compile and run the Mayan Numeral Converter to input a number and view its Mayan numeral equivalent.

## Documentation
Each class includes Javadoc comments with detailed descriptions, parameters, and return values.
